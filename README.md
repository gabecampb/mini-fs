# Mini FS

This is a Unix-like file system implementation written in C that aims to be simple and compact. My goal is to allow it to be easily integrated into small personal projects. It simply uses a global pointer to an array that stores, by default, a blank disk. This array can be used as a RAM disk or saved from memory to a file for non-volatile use.
